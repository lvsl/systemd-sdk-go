# systemd-sdk-go
Golang SDK for [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) service manager

## What is systemd?
[Systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is a de-facto standard service manager on [majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#Adoption) of mainstream Linux distributions.

### Why SDK?
Current available [bindings](https://github.com/coreos/go-systemd) are too low-level and bloated.

The goal on this project is provide more high-level and lean set of building blocks,
but without restricting too much.

P.S.
Project was inspired by [rkt](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/devel/architecture.md) (which seems mostly abandoned now).

## Project Status
Early WIP.
